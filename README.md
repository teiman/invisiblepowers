A game about invisible powers controlling the world and the incoming apocalypse

Current gameplay:
 - Tryiing to stop any of the factions from getting to DEFCON6 and destroyoing the civilization

My objetives:
 - To learn more about game developing 

What I have learned:
 - Doing pixel art is fun and rewarding
 - Doing Game Design is hard 
 - Even simple ideas can get complicated when you get to the fine details 

Future for this proyect:
 - I am still trying to turn this into something fun, no success so far

On the current state the gameplay loop is not a joy,  so I need to redo this part that is basically the heart of the game. If everything fails, I may spawn a new game where only the gameplay loop exist.
